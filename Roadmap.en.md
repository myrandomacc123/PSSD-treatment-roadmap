# General

PSSD is a potentially significant problem for people taking psychotropic medications, such as: antidepressants, antipsychotics, and others. Formally, this term means Post-SSRI sexual dysfunction [Post-SSRI sexual dysfunction](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-SSRI_sexual_dysfunction).

However, currently, it encompasses a broader range of issues: sexual dysfunction, anhedonia, loss of motivation, cognitive impairment (brain fog, decreased overall intelligence, etc.)[add links]

# Roadmap

### 1. Diagnosis and Tests

(1) What objective methods exist (hormonal panels, neuropsychological tests, fMRI, PET, EEG)?

(2) How to differentiate PSSD from a relapse of depression or other psychiatric conditions?

(3) Are there biomarkers that are already being researched?

### 2. Treatment

What are the current treatment strategies?

(1) Non-pharmacological treatment: simply waiting for it to pass, sports, diet, sleep, lifestyle correction, etc.

(2) Pharmacological treatment: dopaminergic agents, 5-HT1A agonists, hormone therapy, etc.

(3) Psychological/psychiatric help

### 3. Research

What research is currently being conducted on the causes of PSSD?
What hypotheses are being proposed for the mechanism of PSSD (receptor desensitization, epigenetic changes, neuroplasticity)?

### 4. Patient Communities

https://www.reddit.com/r/PSSD/

https://www.pssdforum.org/

### 5. Resources dedicated to PSSD

https://www.pssdforum.org/

https://www.pssdnetwork.org/

https://www.reddit.com/r/PSSD/

🟥 TODO: Maybe create a separate website pssdwiki.org in the style of Wikipedia on the WikiMedia engine. On this site, in the format of pages like in Wiki, you could place all this information instead of writing it here in Markdown on Github

### 6. Media about PSSD

### 7. Popularize PSSD theme on social networks such as Tiktok, Instagram, etc

### 8. Scientific journals, scientific communities about PSSD

### 9. Donations for research and other needs

List here all the research that requires donations and ways to donate. Take into account that currently, in some countries, Visa does not work (Russia), and making a donation through Visa is problematic.

### 10. Develop mobile apps, PWA, sites

(1) It seems good to have mobile app where patient can share their symptoms and so on (anonymously). This can be **voice interface** to simple interaction with the app.
Then this (anonymous) data can be used to collect more general symtoms of PSSD. Also we can get absolute count of users faced with PSSD (may be this is unusful info :))
Instead of native mobile app it can be ReactNative app or event just React or Angular PWA app

(2) It seems to good to have sites maybe based on google forms where patient also can share some info for stats

(3) Maybe it's usefull to have such mobile app: a patient follows a certain treatment plan, marking their actions in a **calendar by date** (exercise, diet, medication, supplements, etc.) and can **share their treatment** with others directly along with checkpoints (dates) showing what was done and when, so that others can try it as well (on their risk). Also you can like/dislike this treatment to get some very basic ranking of all treatments.
