# General
PSSD is a potentially significant problem for people taking psychotropic medications, such as: antidepressants, antipsychotics, and others. Formally, this term means Post-SSRI sexual dysfunction.

However, currently, it encompasses a broader range of issues: sexual dysfunction, anhedonia, loss of motivation, cognitive impairment (brain fog, decreased overall intelligence, etc.)[add links]

# Roadmap

### 1. Diagnosis and Tests
(1) What objective methods exist (hormonal panels, neuropsychological tests, fMRI, PET, EEG)?

(2) How to differentiate PSSD from a relapse of depression or other psychiatric conditions?

(3) Are there biomarkers that are already being researched?

### 2. Treatment
What are the current treatment strategies?

(1) Non-pharmacological treatment: simply waiting for it to pass, sports, diet, sleep, lifestyle correction, etc.

(2) Pharmacological treatment: dopaminergic agents, 5-HT1A agonists, hormone therapy, etc.

(3) Psychological/psychiatric help

### 3. Research
What research is currently being conducted on the causes of PSSD?
What hypotheses are being proposed for the mechanism of PSSD (receptor desensitization, epigenetic changes, neuroplasticity)?

### 4. Patient Communities
https://www.reddit.com/r/PSSD/

https://www.pssdforum.org/

### 5. Resources dedicated to PSSD
https://www.pssdforum.org/

https://www.pssdnetwork.org/

https://www.reddit.com/r/PSSD/

<font color="red">TODO: Maybe create a separate website pssdwiki.org in the style of Wikipedia on the WikiMedia engine. On this site, in the format of pages like in Wiki, you could place all this information instead of writing it here in Markdown on Github</font>

### 6. Media about PSSD
### 7. Popularize PSSD theme on social networks such as Tiktok, Instagram, etc

### 8. Scientific journals, scientific communities about PSSD

### 9. Donations for research and other needs
List here all the research that requires donations and ways to donate. Take into account that currently, in some countries, Visa does not work (Russia), and making a donation through Visa is problematic.
